    <h2>Welcome to the Sault Potters Guild</h2>        
    <p>The Sault Potters Guild is a professional studio space home to over 40 members located in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.  A place where creativity takes on a new meaning and where new friendships are made - we strive to learn and educate about the ancient craft of pottery... a piece of the present that will become part of history. </p>
    <p>The Sault Potters Guild was first established in 1969 and is one of the oldest pottery guilds in Ontario.  It was incorporated in 1988 as a Not For Profit and with the support of our strong membership, the Guild has continued to grow.  We have seen great interest of our craft from the City and Arts Community of Sault Ste. Marie & Algoma District and we are made up of hobbyist and professional potters who love to play and experiment with clay. </p>

      <p>“And now indeed this substance with its precious humility becomes, through its indestructibility, the most faithful bearer of man's message. As far back as one goes in time, the works of humanity from prehistoric times have reached us not through stone which crumbles and wears away, or through metal which oxidizes and becomes like powder, but through slabs of pottery, the writing on which is as clear today as it was under the stiletto of the scribe who traced it.”</p>
